 * @file game.h
 *
 * @brief This files describes the programming interface of a puzzle
 * game, named 'Haunted Mirror'.
 *
 * @mainpage
 *
 * This game was originally invented by David Millar, under the name
 * 'Haunted Mirror Maze'.  A demo of this game is provided in the
 * Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection, under the name <a
 * href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/undead.html">'Undead'</a>.
 *
 * The game board is a grid of 4x4 squares, that initially contains
 * some diagonal mirrors (/ or \\).
 * The aim of the game is to place a ghost (G), a vampire (V), a zombie (Z) or  Spirit (S)
 * on each empty square of the board, so that the expected number of monsters
 * (given by labels on the four sides) can be seen in each direction, and the
 * total number of monsters of each type match the indicated number.
 *
 * Starting from the edge of the board (on the N, S, E or W side) at a
 * given position, your line of sight draws a path that is reflected
 * successively by mirrors before it exits through another side.
 * On this line of sight, Ghosts are only visible when reflected in
 * at least one mirror, vampires are visible unless they are reflected in a
 * mirror, while Zombies are always visible. Spirit are never visible.
 * For further details on the rules, see <a
 * href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/undead.html">here</a>.
 *
 * We use coordinates for the squares of the grid, (0,0) being the bottom
 * left corner, and the first coordinate indicating the column.
 * *
 * Here is an example of a game at start and its solution at end.
 *

 @endverbatim
 * Observe for example that the label 0 on the left of North line
 * says that no monster should be visible from there, thus squares
 * (1,3) and (2,3) must contain monsters not visible when reflected in a mirror,
 * that is Vampires.
