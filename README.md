# Undead
 Undead is a puzzle game (similar to Sudoku) in which you have to place monsters in a grid according to specific criteria for each monster.
 
 ## Rules
 The game board is a grid of 4x4 squares, that initially contains some diagonal mirrors `/` or `\\`. <br>
 The aim of the game is to place a ghost (G), a vampire (V), a zombie (Z) or a spirit (S) on each empty square of the board. So that expected number of monsters (given by labels on the four sides) can be seen in each direction and the total number of monsters of each type match the indicated number.<br><br> 
Starting from the edge of the board (on the N, S, E or W side) at a given position, your line of sight draws a path that is reflected successively by mirrors before it exits through another side.<br>
On this line of sight, ghosts are only visible when reflected in at least one mirror, vampires are visible unless they are reflected in a mirror, while zombies are always visible, spirits are never visible.
